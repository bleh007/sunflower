      <h2>Hey My Sunflower ðŸŒ»</h2>
      <p>
        Hey My sunflower,

this message is for u cause ur dada was worried and sad to see u so he thought writing his love for u 
so brace yourself coz he is not gonna stop probably the charge might end in his bujji but the love he 
has for you wont has the sun won't go down and as the water on earth wont dry up and as the starts on 
the universe is countless u are the person who thought me what it is like to be felt special 
u thought me many things and i'm grateful for you as well as u are the most precious person to him 
since the first time ur dada met u after a long time and who knew that when we were young we would 
end up getting obsessed with each other's touch and person's my younger version would be in shock 
as well as he will be a little red too coz that little person had a little secret which he didn't tell
it to anyone before but he had a small thing abt you idk whether to call it a crush or love but after 
that day when we were at the ground and when i was wandering around u come up to me and ask me is anything
wrong it felt good like someone noticed me when i was not doing well and that is the one thing which hasn't 
changed and even now when i think abt it i giggle and after that day he always liked u like a good friend 
it was fun back then when were talking and playing games and ya not that i'm proud of i was kinda jealous
how roshan was comfortable with u talking coz i wasn't i was hesitating to talk to ppl and after that we 
parted ways both of us not knowing that we would end up together and boom ther is that inauguration day 
when we saw eachother's story and met tbh after seeing like 2-3 yrs ig u weren't changed ik i did call u 
fat before but i didn't tell how cute u were back then and back then i like ur smile those puffy cheeks 
which whould wiggle and i like how u chased me annoying u and my fav i like how u would turn red when 
u are shy or angry u would look like an red ripened cherry which was blessed with rain i was an admier
a secret admire even now ohh wait i got out of track i was gonna tell how special u make me feel 
coming back to that , u might remember this or not idk but one night u replied to one of my story 
asking if i was okay the story was a little depressing and i had posted it coz that day my parents 
had an huge fight all my uncle and my aunt had to come to stop it and i couldn't take it anymore 
that was the day when we got our sem 1 results i didn't knew at that time whether to be happy that
i scored well or to be sad that how parents fought so i just came down sat on the edge of the road and cried 
that was time i cried after yrs ig i had all the stored in me and it let out but after that i posted 
and then later when replied it took me back to that young day when u asked me how i was at the playground
it felt good my baby and from that day i got close to you and that closens grew into us becoming good frnds
and then another boom the day when i  got obsessed with ur touch is the day when we all sat in the classroom 
to watch sabbriena idk when u were at my arms it felt like i was having my babygurl with me close it felt like 
home and after that is when my love ur dada got hit by the cupid's arrow which aimed rit into his heart that arrow 
is u and still is the same place
.
.
.
.
what i want to say my sunflower times might be difficult right now  but we cant be distancing eachother coz i believe
it is not against eachother but us against the world and i wanna win this fight i wanna win this fight and claim u 
for the rest of our life and it is possible if u belive in me and not to give up on me nor on urself  stay strong my
love ur dada will get u from ur chaos....
      </p>
